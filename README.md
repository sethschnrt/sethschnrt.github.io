# Horiseon webisite Search Engine Optimization and Accesibility improvements.

## Description
Making this website more accessible for all consumers so we can optimize the site for search engines. We do this by cleaning up the code; this means making sure all of the HTML attributes are correctly placed and chosen, based on the website's sub sections. This also means all css properties are linked properly, and the github repository is set up correctly.

## Project Status
Development of this website had come to an end as this was a school project, and not an actual living, breathing, business.

## Visuals
Here is a link to the finished site: https://sethschnrt.github.io/resume-website/

## Support
For any issues with the website or any questions about its configuration, contact seth.schoenert@gmail.com via email.
